Empous-Control-The-World
========================

The public source for the iOS game Empous: Control the World. Empous is an iOS game I created while in Grad School. Empous is based off Risk and is a turn based strategy game. Since it is turn based, Empous using a client server model to keep all the games in sync. The server code is written using Django. If I had more time, I would have used something with stronger typing like Play! (Java/Scala).

Empous was built using cocos2d and features Facebook and non-Facebook logins. The game is now removed from the App Store mostly due to lack of interest and constant server costs on EC2. 

The code is provided as is as a learning tool. I have removed all identifiable information like server usernames and passwords. All the sized assets are supplied but none of the original Photoshop/Illustrator files are not in the repo.

Below you will find some minimumal instructions to get a local copy of Empous working (mostly setting up a local django server). If you have questions feel free to reach out to me.

READMEs
=====================
There are READMEs in the server and ioscode that will help you run Empous. This repo is a copy of my private repos so I make no guarantees that the install instructions are 100% correct.
